If .po-files are provided, they look like this:
```py
# Comments start with # at the start of a line
msgid "Either the ID for the identification or the text that's getting translated."
msgstr "The translated text here"

# Multi-Line translations:
msgid "theID"
msgstr ""
"New\n"
"line"

# Note, that every line except the last one has to end with '\n' in order for the new line to work
# '\n' represents a line-break-character
```

If no .po-file is given, then it's just plain text.
